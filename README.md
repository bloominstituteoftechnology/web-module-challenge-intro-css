# Intro CSS Module Project

## User Interface and Git

## Objectives

- learn about the box model and be able to explain its properties
- demonstrate CSS specificity and inheritance to create and update styles
- implement a CSS reset and understand why it’s important for cross-browser development
- describe and use responsive units (px, em, rem, %, and vw.vh) to create a fully responsive website

## Introduction

In this project you will be styling a single page with more advanced CSS. This page is a take on the government's [national parks website](https://www.nps.gov/yose/index.htm) and includes some basic information about Yosemite National Park in California.

The styles in your [design file](/design/desktop.jpg) include bright colors and fun icons to get people excited about exploring the outdoors. With a little work, this could even be refactored into a 3rd-party national parks guide site or blog.

## Instructions

### Task 1: Set Up The Project With Git

Follow these steps to set up and work on your project:

- [ ] Fork the repository, then clone from your fork.
- [ ] Go into Canvas and connect your repository by copy-pasting its Github URL into the submission slot.
- [ ] DO NOT CREATE A BRANCH. You will be pushing your changes to the main/master today.
- [ ] cd into your repository on the command line and use code . to open VS Code.
- [ ] Download the Live Server extension from the Extensions tab on the left side of your VS Code. After it is done installing, click "Go Live" on the bottom right side of your screen to run your HTML file.
- [ ] Complete your work making regular commits to the main branch; your submitted URL will always reflect your most recent work.

### Task 2: Minimum Viable Product

Once your repository is set up, practice what you learned today to style the site according to the given design. Your complete project should look similar to the desktop image. You should take the following actions, at a minimum:

- [x] Link your CSS stylesheet in the `index.html` and implement a CSS reset 
- [x] Markup html semantically, such that it can be styled according to the given desktop image
- [x] Color the background of items in the navigation bar and footer with the following colors:
  - [x] Plan your Visit: `#FF764E`
  - [x] Learn About the Park: `#5ED3EB`
  - [x] Get Involved: `#FFCD69`
- [x] Change all font colors and styles according to design file
  - [x] Yosemite Park Guide font is called Chelsea Market and can be found on [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Chelsea+Market)
  - [x] All other text is Roboto Mono, also available on [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Mono)
- [x] Color the background of the main text body with `#DDB9A3`
- [x] Color the background of the footer with `#F9E7DC`
- [x] Bold the words "current fire restrictions" and "park entrance fee" according to the design file
- [x] Apply box model properties (content, padding, margin, and border) to all content such that your webpage matches the design file. This will include at least:
  - [x] A round image in the header
  - [x] Round corners on navigation and footer items
  - [x] Header image and text side by side
  - [x] Centered content and margins around content
  - [x] Footer image positioning

**Throughout your design you should avoid static units (pixels), and should instead use responsive units wherever possible.**

**Please note that you CANNOT use flexbox on today's project - you must achieve your layout using inline-block**


### Task 3: Stretch Goals

The following goals are designed to stretch your knowledge and may require additional research beyond what was learned in class today.

- [ ] Add CSS animations (hover, mouseover, etc.)
- [ ] Design and execute your own pages for `Plan your Visit`, `Learn About the Park`, or `Get Involved`
- [ ] Use [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/) to convert the campfire and RV images to real favicons and use them in your project
- [ ] Host your website on Netlify.com
