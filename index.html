        but within its nearly 1,200 square miles, you can find deep valleys, 
        grand meadows, ancient giant sequoias, a vast wilderness area, and 
        much more.</h3>

      <p>Fire is a natural and essential part of Yosemite. We manage fire carefully and study how it interacts with 
      the park's ecosystems. This blog provides updates about fires in Yosemite. Check for current fire 
      restrictions.</p>

      <p>We strongly recommend that you make reservations for lodging, camping, and backpacking. You can pay 
      the park entrance fee upon arrival (there's no need to pay it in advance).</p>
