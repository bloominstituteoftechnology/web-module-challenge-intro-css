        First protected in 1864, Yosemite National Park is best known for its waterfalls, but
        within its nearly 1,200 square miles, you can find deep valleys, grand meadows, ancient
        giant sequoias, a vast wilderness area, and much more.

      <p>Fire is a natural and essential part of Yosemite. We manage fire carefully and study how it interacts with the park’s ecosystems. This blog provides updates about fires in Yosemite. Check for current fire restrictions.</p>
