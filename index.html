  <p>Not just a great valley, but a shrine to human foresight, 
  the strength of granite, the power of glaciers, 
  the persistence of life, and the tranquility of the High Sierra.</p>

  <p>First protected in 1864, Yosemite National Park is best known 
  for its waterfalls, but within its nearly 1,200 square miles, 
  you can find deep valleys, grand meadows, ancient giant sequoias, 
  a vast wilderness area, and much more.</p>

  <p>Fire is a natural and essential part of Yosemite. 
  We manage fire carefully and study how it interacts 
  with the park’s ecosystems. This blog provides updates 
  about fires in Yosemite. Check for <span>current fire restrictions.</span></p>

  <p>We strongly recommend that you make reservations for lodging, 
  camping, and backpacking. You can pay the <span>park entrance fee</span> 
  upon arrival (there's no need to pay it in advance).</p>
