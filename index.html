      <p>Not just a great valley, but a shrine to human foresight, the strength of granite,<br>
        the power of glaciers, the persistence of life, and the tranquility of the High Sierra.<br><br>
      
      First protected in 1864, Yosemite National Park is best known for its waterfalls, but<br>
      within its nearly 1,200 square miles, you can find deep valleys, grand meadows, ancient<br>
      giant sequoias, a vast wilderness area, and much more.</p>

      <p>Fire is a natural and essential<br>
      part of Yosemite. We manage fire<br>
      carefully and study how it<br>
      interacts with the park’s<br>
      ecosystems. This blog provides<br>
      updates about fires in Yosemite.<br>
      Check for <strong>current fire restrictions.</strong></p>

      <p>We strongly recommend that you make<br>
      reservations for lodging, camping,<br>
      and backpacking. You can pay the<br>
      <strong>park entrance fee</strong> upon arrival<br>
      (there's no need to pay it in advance).</p>
