		<h1>Yosemite Park Guide</h1>
		<h2>Come explore California’s beautiful wilderness.</h2>
		Always open. Reservations are not available or required to enter the park.
		Not just a great valley, but a shrine to human foresight, the strength of
		granite, the power of glaciers, the persistence of life, and the tranquility
		of the High Sierra. First protected in 1864, Yosemite National Park is best
		known for its waterfalls, but within its nearly 1,200 square miles, you can
		find deep valleys, grand meadows, ancient giant sequoias, a vast wilderness
		area, and much more. "https://image.flaticon.com/icons/svg/2979/2979348.svg"
		Fire is a natural and essential part of Yosemite. We manage fire carefully
		and study how it interacts with the park’s ecosystems. This blog provides
		updates about fires in Yosemite. Check for current fire restrictions.
		"https://image.flaticon.com/icons/svg/820/820374.svg" We strongly recommend
		that you make reservations for lodging, camping, and backpacking. You can
		pay the park entrance fee upon arrival (there's no need to pay it in
		advance).
