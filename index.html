			Not just a great valley, but a shrine to human foresight, the strength of

			First protected in 1864, Yosemite National Park is best known for its
			waterfalls, but within its nearly 1,200 square miles, you can find deep
			valleys, grand meadows, ancient giant sequoias, a vast wilderness area,
			and much more.

			Fire is a natural and essential part of Yosemite. We manage fire carefully
			and study how it interacts with the park’s ecosystems. This blog provides
			updates about fires in Yosemite. Check for

			backpacking. You can pay the
