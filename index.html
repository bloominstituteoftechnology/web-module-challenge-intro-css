      <p>First protected in 1864, Yosemite National Park is best known for its waterfalls, but within its nearly 1,200
        square miles, you can find deep valleys, grand meadows, ancient giant sequoias, a vast wilderness area, and much
        more.</p>

      <p>Fire is a natural and essential part of Yosemite. We manage fire carefully and study how it interacts with the
        park’s ecosystems. This blog provides updates about fires in Yosemite. <span>Check for current fire
          restrictions.</span></p>

      <p>We strongly recommend that you make reservations for lodging, camping, and backpacking. You can pay the
        <span>park entrance fee</span> upon arrival (there's no need to pay it in advance).
