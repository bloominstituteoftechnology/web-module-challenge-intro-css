          within its nearly 1,200 square miles, you can find deep valleys, grand
          meadows, ancient <br />

            Fire is a natural and essential <br />
            part of Yosemite. We manage fire <br />
            carefully and study how it <br />
            interacts with the park’s <br />
            ecosystems. This blog provides <br />
            updates about fires in Yosemite. <br />
