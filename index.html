    Always open. Reservations are not available or required to enter the park.
    Not just a great valley, but a shrine to human foresight, the strength of
    granite, the power of glaciers, the persistence of life, and the tranquility
    of the High Sierra. First protected in 1864, Yosemite National Park is best
    known for its waterfalls, but within its nearly 1,200 square miles, you can
    find deep valleys, grand meadows, ancient giant sequoias, a vast wilderness
    area, and much more.
    <img src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/128/785/785116.png" alt="Fire" /> Fire is
    a natural and essential part of Yosemite. We manage fire carefully and study
    how it interacts with the park’s ecosystems. This blog provides updates
    about fires in Yosemite. Check for current fire restrictions.

    that you make reservations for lodging, camping, and backpacking. You can
    pay the park entrance fee upon arrival (there's no need to pay it in
    advance).
