      <p>Not just a great valley, but a shrine to human foresight, the strength of granite, the <br>power of glaciers, the persistence of life, and the tranquility of the High Sierra.</p>


      <p>First protected in 1864, Yosemite National Park is best known for its waterfalls, but<br> within its nearly 1,200 square miles, you can find deep valleys, grand meadows, ancient<br> giant sequoias, a vast wilderness area, and much more.</p>

      <p>Fire is a natural and essential part of Yosemite. We manage fire carefully and study how it interacts with the park’s ecosystems. This blog provides updates about fires in Yosemite. Check for <b>current fire restrictions.</b></p>
