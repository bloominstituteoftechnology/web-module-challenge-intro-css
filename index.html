      First protected in 1864, Yosemite National Park is best known for its waterfalls, 
      but within its nearly 1,200 square miles, you can find deep valleys, grand meadows, 
      ancient giant sequoias, a vast wilderness area, and much more.

      with the park’s ecosystems. This blog provides updates about fires in Yosemite.
