    <p>Not just a great valley, but a shrine to human foresight, the strength of granite, the power of glaciers, the persistence of life, and the tranquility of the High Sierra.</p>
    <p>First protected in 1864, Yosemite National Park is best known for its waterfalls, but within its nearly 1,200 square miles, you can find deep valleys, grand meadows, ancient giant sequoias, a vast wilderness area, and much more.</p>

<!-- This project was extremely frustrating for me to complete. I was offered a lot of help and ultimately followed the solution guide near the end to get my work to line up as close to what was meant to be presented. I learned a lot through out this work and will spend a bunch more time learning CSS before moving on to the next section's module challenge,

Thank you for your time.-->
