      <h1>Yosemite Park Guide</h1>

      <h2>Come explore California’s beautiful wilderness.</h2>

        <p>Always open. Reservations are not available or required to enter the park.</p>
      
        <p>Not just a great valley, but a shrine to human foresight, the strength of granite, the power of glaciers, the persistence of life, and the tranquility of the High Sierra.
        </p>
      
        <p>First protected in 1864, Yosemite National Park is best known for its waterfalls, but within its nearly 1,200 square miles, you can find deep valleys, grand meadows, ancient giant sequoias, a vast wilderness area, and much more.

      Fire is a natural and essential part of Yosemite. We manage fire carefully and study how it interacts with the park’s ecosystems. This blog provides updates about fires in Yosemite. Check for <strong>current fire restrictions</strong>.

        <p>We strongly recommend that you make reservations for lodging, camping, and backpacking. You can pay the <strong>park entrance fee</strong> upon arrival (there's no need to pay it in advance).</p>
