				Not just a great valley, but a shrine to human foresight, the strength

				<br>First protected in 1864, Yosemite National Park is best known for its
				waterfalls, but within its nearly 1,200 square miles, you can find deep
				valleys, grand meadows, ancient giant sequoias, a vast wilderness area,
				and much more.

				Fire is a natural and essential part of Yosemite. We manage fire
				carefully and study how it interacts with the park’s ecosystems. This
