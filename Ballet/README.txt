Ballet Variable Font
====================

This download contains Ballet as both a variable font and static fonts.

Ballet is a variable font with this axis:
  opsz

This means all the styles are contained in a single file:
  Ballet-Regular-VariableFont_opsz.ttf

If your app fully supports variable fonts, you can now pick intermediate styles
that arenâ€™t available as static fonts. Not all apps support variable fonts, and
in those cases you can use the static font files for Ballet:
  static/Ballet_16pt-Regular.ttf
  static/Ballet_18pt-Regular.ttf
  static/Ballet_20pt-Regular.ttf
  static/Ballet_24pt-Regular.ttf
  static/Ballet_28pt-Regular.ttf
  static/Ballet_36pt-Regular.ttf
  static/Ballet_48pt-Regular.ttf
  static/Ballet_60pt-Regular.ttf
  static/Ballet_72pt-Regular.ttf

Get started
-----------

1. Install the font files you want to use
